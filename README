Mirasol is a program for teaching numbers, inspired by Glenn Doman's flash cards. Unlike the flash cards, which just show each number in one random arrangement, Mirasol shows numbers in several shapes:
•Asteraceous (Random arrangement is possible, but currently disabled.)
•Decimal
•Hexadecimal
•Composite (e.g. 30 may be shown as six groups of five)
•Prime (which is just asteraceous, but only for primes)
•Fibonacci (Kepler triangle)
•Square
•Pronic (n*(n+1))
•Triangle
•Centered hexagon
•5-smooth (e.g. 900 is shown as 4 groups of 9 groups of 25).
So if you have 144 dots, you can show them as square or as Fibonacci; if you have 36 dots, you can show them as square or as triangle. If you like Doman's or Shichida's method, try this program.

To compile, if you're not developing the program:
1. Create a subdirectory build/ inside the directory where you untarred the source code.
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make

If you are developing the program:
1. Create a directory build/mirasol outside the directory where you cloned the source code.
2. cd build/mirasol
3. cmake <directory where the source code is>
4. make

System requirements:
•Any sort of Unix-like system, such as Linux or BSD (Cygwin on Windows should work, but I haven't tried it)
•An X server, preferably local
•Qt5
•A fast enough processor for animation
•CMake 3.1 or later, a C++ compiler, and Qt5 development headers, for compiling.
